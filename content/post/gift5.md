LOL. I've learned a lot about magnetic lashes this week. Not sure what conversation we had that resulted in this being on the list, but here it is! You have one set of lashes + liner combo to experiment with. Apparently, Glamnetics magnetic lashes are the best for Asian eyes?

This post's title comes from the fact that there is a hot debate on the internet about who has the better magnetic liner. The consensus of Cosmetic YouTube is that Moxie's liner is better in general, but Glamnetic's liner is best for oily skin. So best for Maya!
