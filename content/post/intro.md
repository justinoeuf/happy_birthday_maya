As you've already pieced together by now, your gifts this year are related to your summer To-Do list :)

The gifts (posts) on this site are selected items from your original To-Do list along my attempt at helping you complete them. Some are silly, others are more genuine. The gifts can be opened in any order. Use the **Homepage** button on the upper banner to return to the main page; alternatively, you can navigate via the post thumbnails at the bottom of each page.

Wishing you the happiest of birthday's today. And after "opening" your gifts, I hope it's a productive one too.

Love,  
Justin
